Midterm 1 Review Guide

Machine Learning Principles
Bias-variance trade-off
Underfitting/Overfitting
Types of machine learning
KNN
Distance metrics
Classification vs. Regression
Naive Bayes
How to compute the probabilities
Bayes Theorem
Performance
Common performance metrics
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
ROC Curves
Error and Validation
L1, SSE(L2), MSE, RMSE
Delta Rule vs. Perceptron Rule
Cross Validation, N-Fold Cross Validation
Regression’
Simple and multiple linear regression
Logistic regression
Regularization
Early Stopping, Regularization(L2, L1(LASSO)) 
Decision Trees
Interpreting trees
Avoiding overfit
Gini
Support Vector Machines
 

For each of these topics, be able to explain them conceptually and know the why behind them. Ex: Why do we use regularization? Why do we use a train/test split? etc.
